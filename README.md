apt-cyg
=======

A command-line software installer for Cygwin.
Original version is available in http://code.google.com/p/apt-cyg/.

Recently, Cygwin mirror sites changes their directory structure,
and original apt-cyg doesn't work on them anymore.

In this repository, an updated version of apt-cyg which can be used for
new Cygwin mirror site strucuture is available.


## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:rcmdnk/apt-cyg.git
    $ cp apt-cyg/apt-cyg /bin/
    $ rm -rf apt-cyg # if the local repository is not necessary
